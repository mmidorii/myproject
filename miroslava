The dataset is available on the IBM Cloud at the below url.

dataset_url = "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/LargeData/m1_survey_data.csv"
Then we load the data available at dataset_url into a dataframe.

filename = 'survey.csv'
urllib.request.urlretrieve(dataset_url,filename)

df = pd.read_csv(filename)
Exploring the data set
It is a good idea to print the top 5 rows of the dataset to get a feel of how the dataset will look.

So we display the top 5 rows and columns from your dataset.

5 rows × 85 columns

We start by exploring the numbers of rows and columns of data in the dataset, so we can print the number of rows in the dataset.

len(df)
11552
We can print the number of columns in the dataset as well.

len(df.columns)
85
df.shape
(11552, 85)
Identifying the data types of each column
We can explore the dataset and identify the data types of each column, so let's print the datatype of all columns.

df.dtypes
Respondent       int64

Length: 85, dtype: object
Lets print the mean age of the survey participants.

df['Age'].mean()
30.77239449133718
The dataset is the result of a world wide survey. We can find out how many unique countries are there in the Country column.

len(df['Country'].unique())
